Python script at https://github.com/leonardr/olipy

questions:

- what's the difference between using import and using from-import?
- there's a class in this one! it takes an object.
- what's __init__?

okay, I got totally distracted by olipy source and I want to use it for my NaNoGenMo terrible romance novel project, so I'm going to keep going with the Learn Python the Hard Way and come back to this.
